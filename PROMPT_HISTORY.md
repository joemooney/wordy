## Session: GRE Word Review - No Repetition and Completion Detection (2025-10-19)

### Prompt: Prevent Word Repetition and Show End Dialog

**User Request:**
"In GRE Word Review do not repeat words. When you have completed all the words show a end of review dialog."

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Session Word Tracking** (`templates/word_review.html:576`):
   - Added `wordsShownThisSession` Set to track displayed words
   - Cleared when starting new review session
   - Ensures each word shown only once per session

2. **No-Repeat Loading** (`templates/word_review.html:912-941`):
   - Updated `loadNextFilteredWord()` to check `wordsShownThisSession`
   - Skips words already shown: `!wordsShownThisSession.has(newWord.word)`
   - Adds word to set when displayed: `wordsShownThisSession.add(newWord.word)`
   - Increased max attempts from 200 to 300 for exhaustive searches

3. **All Words Complete Detection** (`templates/word_review.html:940`):
   - When max attempts reached without finding new word
   - Calls `endReviewAllWordsComplete()` instead of showing error
   - Indicates all matching words have been reviewed

4. **Completion Dialog** (`templates/word_review.html:943-971`):
   - Special end-of-review modal with celebration
   - Header: "üéâ All Matching Words Completed!"
   - Shows words reviewed and elapsed time
   - Message: "You've reviewed all words matching your selected filters!"
   - Same navigation as normal end: New Review or Home

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add templates/word_review.html
git commit -m "Prevent word repetition and show completion dialog in GRE Word Review"
git push
```

**Commit:** `01314cc`

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/joe/ai/wordy/templates/word_review.html`

**User Experience:**

**No Repetition:**
- Each word appears exactly once during a session
- Arrow key navigation still allows reviewing previous words
- Fresh words loaded for each advance
- No wasted time re-studying same words

**Completion Scenarios:**

1. **Small Filter Set**:
   - Select only Level 1 words (maybe 50 words)
   - Review all 50 words
   - See completion dialog
   - Choose new filter or go home

2. **Favorites Only**:
   - Enable favorites filter (maybe 10 words)
   - Review all favorites
   - Completion dialog confirms all done

3. **Time Expires First**:
   - 3-minute timer with 100+ matching words
   - Timer ends before words exhausted
   - Normal completion (no special message)

4. **Target Count Reached**:
   - Review 20 words with 200+ available
   - Count reached before exhaustion
   - Normal completion

**Benefits:**
- **Efficient**: No repeated words means faster progress
- **Clear Goal**: Know when filter set is fully reviewed
- **Satisfying**: Celebration when completing all words
- **Smart**: Encourages adjusting filters when set exhausted
- **Focused**: Each session reviews unique words

**Example Workflow:**
1. Start review: Level 1 only, 50 matching words
2. Review 20 words, all different
3. Continue reviewing unique words
4. After 50th word, see "All Matching Words Completed! üéâ"
5. Start new review with different filter

## Session: GRE Quiz UX Improvements (2025-10-18)

### Prompt 1: SPACE Key Answer Selection

**User Request:**
"For GRE Vocabulary Quiz SPACE or ENTER should equate to a mouse press to select the button."

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Conditional SPACE Key Behavior** (`templates/quiz.html:1992-2003`):
   - Modified SPACE key handler to check `answersEnabled` state
   - If answers enabled: calls `selectCurrentChoice()` (select highlighted answer)
   - If answers disabled: calls `togglePause()` (pause/resume functionality)
   - Makes SPACE behave identically to ENTER for answer selection

2. **Logic Flow**:
   ```javascript
   if (event.key === ' ' || event.code === 'Space') {
       event.preventDefault();
       if (answersEnabled) {
           selectCurrentChoice();  // Select answer
       } else {
           togglePause();  // Pause/resume
       }
       return;
   }
   ```

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add templates/quiz.html
git commit -m "Add SPACE key answer selection to GRE Vocabulary Quiz"
git push
```

**Commit:** `507a03d`

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/joe/ai/wordy/templates/quiz.html`

## Session: Standardize Round Start Modal Keyboard Shortcuts (2025-10-18)

### Prompt: Add Standard Keyboard Controls to Game Start Dialogs

**User Request:**
"In the start dialogs for the games. E.g. Round Mode dialog for GRE Definitions, the SPACE or ENTER should start the round and ESC should return to home. This is how the GRE Spelling Quiz is and we should have this as a standard for the other games."

**Implementation Details:**

1. **GRE Vocabulary Quiz** (`templates/quiz.html:1937-1961`):
   - Added Round Start Modal keyboard shortcuts
   - SPACE or ENTER ‚Üí `startNewRound()`
   - ESC ‚Üí return to home (`window.location.href = '/'`)
   - Also added Settings modal ESC handler ‚Üí `closeSettings()`

2. **Inverse GRE Quiz** (`templates/inverse_quiz.html:1932-1956`):
   - Applied identical keyboard shortcuts to Round Start Modal
   - SPACE or ENTER ‚Üí `startNewRound()`
   - ESC ‚Üí return to home
   - Added Settings modal ESC handler ‚Üí `closeSettings()`

3. **Modal Detection Pattern** (both files):
   ```javascript
   // Handle keyboard shortcuts in Round Start modal
   if (document.getElementById('roundStartModal').classList.contains('show')) {
       switch(event.key) {
           case ' ':
           case 'Spacebar':
           case 'Enter':
               event.preventDefault();
               startNewRound();
               break;
           case 'Escape':
               event.preventDefault();
               window.location.href = '/';
               break;
       }
       return;
   }

   // Handle keyboard shortcuts in Settings modal
   if (document.getElementById('settingsModal').classList.contains('show')) {
       if (event.key === 'Escape') {
           event.preventDefault();
           closeSettings();
       }
       return;
   }
   ```

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add templates/quiz.html templates/inverse_quiz.html
git commit -m "Standardize keyboard shortcuts for Round Start modals"
git push
```

**Commit:** `253ade0`

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/joe/ai/wordy/templates/quiz.html`
- `/home/joe/ai/wordy/templates/inverse_quiz.html`

**User Experience:**
- **Consistent**: All quiz games now have identical keyboard controls
- **Efficient**: Start games with SPACE/ENTER without reaching for mouse
- **Intuitive**: ESC key provides quick exit to home screen
- **Accessible**: Settings modal also supports ESC to close
- **Power user friendly**: Enables rapid workflow for repeated play sessions

**Pattern Applied:**
This establishes a standard modal keyboard control pattern used across the app:
- Start/Confirm action: SPACE or ENTER
- Cancel/Exit: ESC
- Navigation: Arrow keys (where applicable)

## Session: Home Page Menu Card Styling (2025-10-18)

### Prompt: Fix Inconsistent Card Styling

**User Request:**
"On the Home page. GRE Vocabulary is a different color button. The others are black on white, it is white on blue. Make all the same. If we want to put white on blue for the selected game that would be nice."

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Removed Active State** (`templates/home.html`):
   - Removed hardcoded `active` class from GRE Vocabulary card
   - Eliminated `.menu-card.active` CSS rules
   - All cards now default to gray gradient background

2. **Selected State Enhancement** (`templates/home.html:81-98`):
   - Moved white-on-blue gradient to `.menu-card.selected` class
   - Applied gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`
   - White text for icon, title, and description when selected
   - Transform and shadow effects for visual feedback

3. **Consistent Default Styling**:
   - All cards: `linear-gradient(135deg, #f8f9fa 0%, #e9ecef 100%)`
   - Black text (#333) on light gray background
   - Uniform appearance when not selected

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add templates/home.html
git commit -m "Fix home page menu card styling consistency"
git push
```

**Commit:** `f6f3e2d`

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/joe/ai/wordy/templates/home.html`

**User Experience:**
- All cards have consistent default styling
- Selected card (via keyboard navigation) gets highlighted with purple gradient
- Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected states
- Professional, uniform appearance

## Session: Fix Keyboard/Mouse Navigation Conflict (2025-10-18)

### Prompt: Resolve Blue Border Conflict

**User Request:**
"there is a little conflict between the mouse and the arrow keys. the location of the mouse has a blue border on that game that is left in place even when we arrow key to another game. Maybe just hide that if the arrow key is pressed?"

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Keyboard Mode Detection** (`templates/home.html`):
   - Added `keyboardMode` boolean flag
   - Track when user is navigating with keyboard vs mouse
   - Added `.keyboard-nav` class to container when in keyboard mode

2. **Disable Hover in Keyboard Mode** (`templates/home.html:74-79`):
   - CSS override: `.keyboard-nav .menu-card:hover` with `!important` flags
   - Prevents hover effects during keyboard navigation
   - Removes transform, shadow, and border-color changes

3. **Mode Switching Functions** (`templates/home.html:312-324`):
   - `enableKeyboardMode()`: Sets flag and adds class
   - `disableKeyboardMode()`: Clears flag and removes class
   - Arrow key handlers call `enableKeyboardMode()`
   - Mouse movement calls `disableKeyboardMode()`

4. **Mouse Event Handler** (`templates/home.html:385-396`):
   - Detects mouse movement
   - Exits keyboard mode on movement
   - Restores normal hover behavior

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add templates/home.html
git commit -m "Fix keyboard/mouse navigation conflict on home page"
git push
```

**Commit:** `dd29f8c`

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/joe/ai/wordy/templates/home.html`

**User Experience:**
- No hover border appears during keyboard navigation
- Clean visual feedback for current selection mode
- Seamless transition between keyboard and mouse
- No conflicting visual indicators

## Session: Mouse Movement Threshold for Navigation (2025-10-18)

### Prompt: Fix Focus Jumping Corner Case

**User Request:**
"on the home screen there is a strange corner case where a down arrow scrolls the screen down to the next selection, but if the mouse pointer is over a button higher up in the screen then after a brief moment focus shifts back up from the one you arrowed down to back up to the one where the mouse pointer is located. Perhaps only refocus if the mouse itself is moved a decent distance"

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Movement Threshold System** (`templates/home.html:292-294`):
   - Added `lastMouseX` and `lastMouseY` to track position
   - Set `MOUSE_MOVE_THRESHOLD = 15` pixels
   - Prevents scroll-induced jitter from exiting keyboard mode

2. **Distance Calculation** (`templates/home.html:387-396`):
   - Calculate ŒîX = `abs(currentX - lastX)`
   - Calculate ŒîY = `abs(currentY - lastY)`
   - Pythagorean distance: `‚àö(ŒîX¬≤ + ŒîY¬≤)`
   - Only exit keyboard mode if distance > 15 pixels

3. **Position Tracking** (`templates/home.html:399-405`):
   - Initialize mouse position on first movement
   - Update lastMouseX/Y after significant movement
   - Ignore tiny movements from scrolling or jitter

4. **Applied to Both Pages**:
   - Implemented in `templates/home.html`
   - Implemented in `templates/dictionary.html` for consistency
   - Same 15-pixel threshold across all navigation

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add templates/home.html templates/dictionary.html
git commit -m "Add mouse movement threshold to prevent navigation jitter"
git push
```

**Commit:** `bc41da0`

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/joe/ai/wordy/templates/home.html`
- `/home/joe/ai/wordy/templates/dictionary.html`

**User Experience:**
- Keyboard navigation stable during scrolling
- No focus jumping when mouse is stationary
- Requires intentional mouse movement to switch modes
- 15 pixels is large enough to ignore jitter, small enough to feel responsive

**Technical Details:**
- Pythagorean theorem ensures diagonal movement is measured correctly
- Threshold prevents: scroll events, touchpad jitter, accidental touches
- First movement event initializes position (prevents false trigger on page load)

## Session: Clear Game History Feature (2025-10-18)

### Prompt: Add Clear History Option

**User Request:**
"In the GRE Spelling Quiz settings have an option to clear the history of games"

**Implementation Details:**

   - Added new section below settings with visual separation
   - Red text (#dc3545) for "Danger Zone" label
   - Warning: "This action cannot be undone."
   - Red button: "üóëÔ∏è Clear All Game History"

2. **clearHistory() Function** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:1260-1283`):
   - Confirmation dialog with detailed explanation
   - Lists what will be deleted:
     - All leaderboard scores
     - All game history data
     - Baseline settings
   - Only proceeds if user confirms

3. **localStorage Cleanup**:
   - Removes `spellingQuizLeaderboard`
   - Removes `spellingQuizOriginalSettings`
   - Preserves current game settings (not cleared)

4. **Success Feedback**:
   - Shows success alert after clearing
   - Closes settings modal automatically
   - User can start fresh with current settings as new baseline

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add templates/spelling_quiz.html
git commit -m "Add clear history option to GRE Spelling Quiz settings"
git push
```

**Commit:** `562b1ef`

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/joe/ai/wordy/templates/spelling_quiz.html`

**User Experience:**
- Clear visual separation for destructive action
- Red color warns users of permanence
- Detailed confirmation prevents accidental deletion
- Clean slate allows experimenting with new scoring systems
- Integrates with baseline settings system (next game becomes new baseline)
