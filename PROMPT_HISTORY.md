### Prompt: Complete Perfect vs Completed Word Bonus System

**User Request:**
"Increase Perfect Word default to 100 points. But if any letter is incorrectly entered it is no longer perfect but Completed which defaults to 50 points. So completed is the same as Perfect is now (no hint or reveals). And perfect requires no mistaken letters typed."

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Settings Updated** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:773-787`):
   - Changed `perfectWordBonus` from 50 to 100
   - Added `completedWordBonus: 50`
   - Added `wrongLetterThisWord` tracking flag

2. **Word Tracking** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:1530-1556`):
   - Reset both `usedHelpThisWord` and `wrongLetterThisWord` in `displayWord()`
   - Initialize `currentWordResult` with both `perfectWord` and `completedWord` flags

3. **Wrong Letter Detection** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:1773-1779`):
   - Set `wrongLetterThisWord = true` when wrong letter typed
   - Mark `currentWordResult.perfectWord = false`

4. **Bonus Logic** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:1968-1982`):
   - If no help and no wrong letters → Perfect Word (+100)
   - If no help but had wrong letters → Completed Word (+50)
   - Mark `completedWord = false` if help was used

5. **Visual Feedback** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:1914-1926`):
   - Created `showCompletedWordBonus()` with blue background
   - Shows "✅ Completed Word! +50 bonus points!"

6. **Settings UI** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:641-650`):
   - Added Perfect Word Bonus input (default 100)
   - Added Completed Word Bonus input (default 50)

7. **Settings Persistence** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:1395`):
   - Updated `saveSettings()` to save `completedWordBonus`
   - Updated `updateSettingsUI()` to load `completedWordBonus`

8. **Score Display** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:1454-1463, 1480-1489`):
   - Updated start screen to show both bonuses
   - Updated pause screen to show both bonuses
   - Changed Perfect Word description to "no hints/reveals/mistakes"
   - Added Completed Word description "no hints/reveals but had mistakes"

9. **Score Recalculation** (`templates/spelling_quiz.html:1033-1040`):
   - Updated `recalculateScore()` to apply `completedWordBonus`
   - Uses else-if logic: perfectWord takes precedence, then completedWord

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Implement Perfect vs Completed word bonus distinction"
git push
```

**Commit:** `bfc8d74`

**Files Modified:**
